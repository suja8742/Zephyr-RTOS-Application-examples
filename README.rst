Zephyr RTOS Workshop Codebase

stm32_print (../samples/stm32_print) contains a ready-to-build sample repository that demonstrates a simple hello world using a printk. You can follow the video to modify the Baud Rate of this sample.

stm32_logger (../samples/stm32_logger) contains the solution sample folder to demonstrate the features of the logger module in Zephyr, which is a more sophisticated logging system than the console. You can use multiple Kconfig options to see how this changes the logging module. The aim is to explore different features of this module, refer to the PPT.

stm32_gpio_custom (../samples/stm32_gpio_custom) contains the solution sample folder to demonstrate a LED toggle example in response to a button interrupt. The aim is to understand how to setup a Hardware module in Zephyr.
